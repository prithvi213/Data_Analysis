# Data_Analysis

This is a Python Program which uses the matplotlib library to generate plots as part of a data analysis. This is a sub-project from the FileRetriever_Test (also on my repository). It also uses the psycopg library to store files and retrieve files from the database. My database name is FileRetriever.

# Execution Command
